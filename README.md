## Overview

This lab contains a series of questions meant to review vocabulary and concepts from the Data Science 2 with R (STAT 301-2).

Ideally, students will be able to answer these things without having to look things up. Could really think of these as interview questions for a data scientist/analyst position.

## Instructions

After creating their own github repo and connecting it to their RStudio, students should work through the questions provided in `LO1_review.html`. A template is provided (rename as lastname_firstname_L01.Rmd).

Students will need to submit their knitted html file which should contain a link to their github repo. See canvas for submission details.
